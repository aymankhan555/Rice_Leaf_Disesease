# Rice_Leaf_Disesease

The main goal is to build and evaluate convolutional neural network (CNN) models to automatically classify images of rice leaves into three different disease categories:

1.  **Bacterialblight** – A bacterial infection causing lesions and yellowing.
2.  **Leafsmut** – A fungal disease that produces black, powdery spores on leaves.
3.  **Brownspot** – A common rice leaf disease causing brown lesions on the leaf surface.
